## Topics Discussed

We discussed heavily about the uses of a domain model and how to design it. Colin was fantastic in explaining this and provided a lot of great resources for moving forward, primarially libraries for C# dealing with CRON strings. Also recived feed back on various documents and preparing a presentation for the client meeting.
