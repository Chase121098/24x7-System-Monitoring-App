## Topics Discussed

Clarified the requirements with the client and dived deeper into the time frame we can all expect moving forward. We also discussed what technologies we would be using to develop certain parts of the project and how we would store and manage the code (BitBucket). So far, everything is fantastic and the client is very eager to begin seeing the development process.

## Things Clarified

We interpreted the requirement of having a central command console as the idea that there would be a terminal which was confusing to us at first but of course a requirement is a requirement. Luckily though, we clarified this and came to the conclusion that a console is a dashboard in theory so this made us relieved and happy to make things smoother.
