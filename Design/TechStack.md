# Tech Stack

## Language: C# and .NET

C# is a great language to create dynamic web pages that have a lot of tools at its disposal. Combined with .NET, it becomes much smoother to build a platform up and create various utilities and services for it to offer. .NET also has a lot of documentation and an active community so it is an easier language to dive into and self teach as opposed to other languages.

## Database: Postgres ,  EF CORE

Postgres is an open source SQL database management system, itâ€™s database transactions have ACID properties. Postgres includes multiversion concurrency control, binary replication, indexes, inheritance, and other features. 

Entity Framework core is an open source object relational mapping framework that allows for data access with .NET. Having EF core will eliminate the need of some data code that would usually need to be written. EF core bridges the gap between maps and objects written in our code Postgres and EF core all allow for integration with .NET and c#

## Hosting: AWS

AWS is a fantastic service that allows a wide variety of services and applications to be run and monitored. There is tons of content and resources to help guide the process and combined with .NET, AWS offers incredible potential for web applications that also require notification services or advanced actions to be done.

## Services: Twillio and Mailgun

Mailgun is a API service that specializes in sending emails after certain triggers are seen and is going to be a fantastic resource for this project. We need to be able to notify clients or third-parties that an error has occurred and email is a fantastic way to document that and reach out to whoever is necessary to fix it.

Twillo is also great for the same reason but with texts which are potentially more dynamic and effective due to a solid majority of people having smartphones on them at all times. With the capability to react to replies as well, this could help allow for acknowledgements that someone has seen the issue and is beginning to work on it.
