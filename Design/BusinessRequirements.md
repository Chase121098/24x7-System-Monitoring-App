#Business Requirements

-	BR1 - Ensure Product Health/Uptime - Ensuring that Accutech’s other applications are healthy and running is an important feature of this software. With the software constantly checking the status of the other applications and alerting an admin if there is a problem, allows for faster response to any potential problem. That way the other applications can get back on track doing what they’re supposed to do and that they are healthy.

-	BR2 - 24/7 Monitoring (Especially Night time) - 24/7 monitoring will help in causing less issues when starting off the work day at 8 am. Using a system that will pull information for errors and send them to the Command Console (BR3) there will be a constant view on common issues that go wrong. Instead of having a person watching for these issues manually, there can be automation set in place to save on time. Getting alerts for when things critically go wrong would be a lot more helpful than walking in on a new work day and finding the system went entirely down.

-	BR3 - Centralized Command Console - A centralized console to be viewed if needed to check statuses or milestones for applications. This information will be pulled from each tracked application automatically without needing manual requests.
