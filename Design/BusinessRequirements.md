# Business Requirements

## BR 1 - 100% Automated

This first requirement is extremely important becuase it is the foundation of this project. We want to require at least possible user maintanance from the client and ensure 24/7 updtime/no crashes for the web app.

## BR 2 - Centralized Command Console

This is the core area where all functions will be triggered/occur. We need to make this clean and useable so that Accutech can use is as well as a potential third party monitor service which was mentioned in a meeting. I imagine this will have a varitey of commands and will be especially useful for custom checks.

## BR 3 - Console to PULL status details from applications

This is important because the whole point of the program is to monitor applications and by giving a command to see the status of all the applications at once, it makes it extremely ease to see the general health of everything and see if any work or corrections are needed.

## BR 4 - Linked/downstream impacts identified

This is a major priority because the last thing we want is for a program to crash and fail and not inform the users of such. We need to find a healthy balance of how often to check, how many failures can happen, and what the potential resolution could be.

## BR 5 - Automatic alerts

Primiary focus and end goal of this project, we need to alert the client and specific users if an error occurs with a product. This needs to be customizable to whatever the needs may be. This is important because the whole purpose of the monitoring system is to be on the watch for issues and then make sure the correct people are aware of what is happening and potentially require a solution or acknowledgement that shows that it is being looked into/is made aware of.
